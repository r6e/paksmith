# Security Policy

## Scope

Paksmith reads and parses binary archive files from potentially untrusted sources. Security-relevant areas include:

- Binary format parsing (buffer overflows, integer overflows, excessive allocations)
- AES decryption key handling
- Network requests to community registries
- File system writes during extraction

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Email the maintainers directly (or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting if enabled on the repository).
3. Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a fix or mitigation within 7 days for critical issues.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release on `main` is actively supported with security fixes.

## Security Practices

- `unsafe` code is denied workspace-wide via lint configuration.
- All dependencies are subject to `cargo audit`, run automatically on every push/PR via the `Security Audit` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Fuzzing targets for binary parsers will be added as the format handling matures.
- AES keys are never logged. Tracing spans for decryption operations omit key material.
- Network requests use HTTPS exclusively. Registry endpoints validate TLS certificates.
- File extraction respects path boundaries — no path traversal via crafted archive entries.
